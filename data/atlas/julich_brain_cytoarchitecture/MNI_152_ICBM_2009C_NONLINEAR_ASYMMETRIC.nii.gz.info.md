MNI 152 ICBM 2009c Nonlinear Asymmetric

description:
---

An unbiased non-linear average of multiple subjects from the MNI152 database, which provides high-spatial resolution and signal-to-noise while not being biased towards a single brain (Fonov et al., 2011). This template space is widely used as a reference space in neuroimaging. HBP provides the JuBrain probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas (Amunts/Zilles, 2015) as well as a probabilistic atlas of large fibre bundles (Guevara, Mangin et al., 2017) in this space.

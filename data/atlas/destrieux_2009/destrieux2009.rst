Destrieux 2009 atlas


Notes
-----
The 'Destrieux' cortical atlas is based on a parcellation scheme
that first divided the cortex into gyral and sulcal regions,
the limit between both being given by the curvature value of the surface.
A gyrus only includes the cortex visible on the pial view,
the hidden cortex (banks of sulci) are marked sulcus.
The result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri.
